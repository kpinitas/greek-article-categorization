% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.


\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{graphicx}


% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % The IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/acronym


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eqparbox




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.
% *** IF USING HYPERREF BE SURE AND CHANGE THE EXAMPLE PDF ***

%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,pdftex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,breaklinks=true,dvips]{hyperref}
%\usepackage{breakurl}
%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as

% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil

\begin{abstract}
Automated text categorization using machine learning techniques has been
proven to be a very efficient way to analyse and classify a vast collection
of documents into different categories. 
In general, text categorization falls into the field of Natural Language

% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed

% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by

% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:

% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{A}{utomated} text categorization is a technique 
ubiquitously used today due to the vast amounts of digital 
information available.
Specifically, article categorization incorporates techinques from
many different fields, such as Data Mining, Linguistics, Information
Retrieval and Natural Language Understanding and can also provide 
very consistent results nowadays given the very large number of text 
documents available.

\par
Generally, document categorization is the process of assigning
multiple classes $\{c_1,c_2,...,c_n\}$ to a certain document
$d_i\in \mathcal{D}$ where $\mathcal{D}$ represents a collection of documents.
However, in this paper we will examine the problem of Hard
Categorization which is a simpler form of text categorization
where each document belongs to only one class $c_j\in C$, 
following a one to one relationship \cite{a1}.
Similarly to every supervised machine learning algorithm,
our goal is to is to find a function $f: \mathcal{D}\rightarrow C$
which maps every document $d_i\in \mathcal{D}$ to exactly one
class $c_j \in C$.
\par
In our implementation of Greek text categorization, our task
was to classify Greek newspaper articles into 6 distinct 
categories C=\{Art, Economy, Greece, Politics, Sports, World\}.
In order to attain this goal, we first collected newspaper articles
from enet newspaper article archive.
After that, following the resolution of several encoding issues 
regarding the Greek UTF-8 glyphs and the stripping of redundant
characters that convey no information (e.g. bullets), we adopted
the standard procedure that is generally used for text classification
problems.
This process, as seen on figure \ref{preprocessing} involves, 
Punctuation Deletion, Accent Stripping, Text Tokenization, 
Neutral Word Removal, Stemming and Lemmatization, 
Vector Representation of each document as Term Document Matrices, 
Feature Transformation, Feature Selection.
\par
As in every other machine learning task, the main problem of text
categorization is to extract features from data in order to create
a numeric representation.
Specifically, in text categorization the main task is to extract
meaningful numerical components that will be used to describe
our documents.
However, due to the very large number of distinct words in a
document (which may range from a few hundred to thousands), 
it is usually considered as a good practice to
implement certain dimensionality reduction techniques in
order to increase the efficiency of Machine Learning Models.
\par
Therefore, various methods can be employed for dimensionality 
reduction.
The first approach is to select a subset of the original features
by using several statistical criteria, such as the variance
or the occurrence frequency of each feature among the 
different classes.
Another approach is to create new, more descriptive features
from the existing ones by applying a series of feature 
transformations.
In this paper we implemented a combination of the aforementioned
methods in order to reduce the dimensionality of our data.
\par
After concluding the stages of preprocessing, our next step
was to implement various Classification Algorithms for different
sets of parameters.
We then extracted evaluation metrics in order to assess the
suitability of each algorithm for the given task.
Finally, in order to generalization capabilities of our algorithms,
we performed kfold cross validation.

\section{Techniques Used}
\subsection{Text Preparation}
Before proceeding to feature creation, it was necessary to
implement a series of text manipulations in order to
prepare for the next steps of the preprocessing phase.

First of all, we stripped our text of punctuation characters 
that convey no useful information, such as dots, commas,
exclamation marks e.t.c.
Secondly, due to the fact that Greek language contains
certain supplementary accent characters, which may negatively
affect the stages of stemming and lemmatization, we had to
replace letters having accent characters with bear letters.
After having removed redundant characters and converted
our text into uppercase, we performed text tokenization
by separating our text into words using space delimiters.

However, not all words in a text provide useful information,
as there are words like articles, pronouns, prepositions
and linking words that just contribute to the cohesion
of the text.
As a result, the distribution of those words among
the texts of different classes are approximately
the same and the existence of those words cannot help
us identify the class that the article belongs to.
That's why we removed those words from the vector
representations of our texts.

In text categorization, due to the fact that the
main meaning of the words are encapsulated into their
roots, it is a common practice to perform stemming and
lemmatization in order to extract the root of each word.
So, that's why we made use of a Greek Stemmer in order
to remove word suffixes.
However, we modified the Greek Stemmer so that it would
not stem certain words, like acronyms in order not to
alter their meaning. 

\subsection{Articles as TF-IDF vectors}
As we wave already mentioned, a document consists of
a set of words and thus, in order to be able to
implement our classification models, we first have
to transform the documents from the word space
into a vector space.
The first step to realize this transformation was
to create a dictionary in order to map words
into their respective indexes.
Due to the fact that in our task the order of words
does not play a significant role in determining the
category of the document, we employed a model called 
tfidf that falls into the category of Bag-Of-Words-Models.
 
According to tfidf model, we can assign weights to different
words by multiplying $\text{TF}\cdot \text{IDF}$, where 
tf is the frequency of a term in a particular document and 
idf is the inverse document frequency of the term \cite{a2}.
Mathematically, if we denote $N_{ij}$ as the number of occurrences
of term $t_i$ in document $d_j$ and $W_j$ the total number
of terms in document $d_j$, then $tf(t_i,d_j) = \frac{N_{ij}}{W_j}$.
Similarly, if $T_{i}$ is the number of texts that contain term $t_i$,
then $idf(t_i) = \log\frac{|\mathcal{D}|}{T_{i}}$.

Consequently, this model allows us to represent each
article $d_j$ as a vector $x_j\in\mathbb{R}^{|V|}$ 
where $|V|$ is the number of words in our dictionary.
Hence, we can represent our collection of articles as
a matrix $X\in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{D}|\times |\mathcal{V}|}$
which is referred to as a term-document matrix.
This model has been proven to be very robust and difficult
to beat, even by more sophisticated models and theories \cite{a2}.

\subsection{Advanced Features}
Instead of using single words as features, it is generally 
considered a good practice to use contiguous sequences of
n words, also known as n-grams, which can help increase
prediction accuracy.
In this paper, we used n-grams for $n=2$, which are called
bigrams.
However, in a collection of texts a huge number of bigrams
can be found.
Hence, in order to select the most descriptive bigrams, 
we utilized the metric of Pointwise Mutual Information.
More specifically, for 2 terms $t_1$ and $t_2$, the
PMI of the 2 terms is given by the formula 
$I(w_1,w_2)=\log_2\frac{P(t_1,t_2)}{P(t_1)P(t_2)}$.

Another commonly used practice for feature creation 
is to group certain terms that would otherwise be
considered useless, into more general groups.
For instance, in our case, we grouped all numerical
data into a single feature because we are mostly
interested in the existence of a number in general
and not an individual number.

\subsection{Feature Transformation}
In many cases, we can improve the performance of
our algorithms by performing a $1-1$ transformation
over the elements of a term document matrix, which
may lead to a better representation of our dataset.
There are several such transformations, but for
the scope of our paper we examined the following:

\begin{table}[!h]
% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
\caption{TFIDF transformations}
\label{transformation}
\centering
% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Transformation & Forumula\\
\hline
\textbf{Binary} & 1 if $x_{ij}>0$ else 0\\
\hline
\textbf{Logarithmic} & $\log(1+x_{ij})$\\
\hline
\textbf{Entropy} & $\Bigg(1+\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}p(x_{ij})\log(p(x_{ij}))}{\log{n}}\Bigg)\cdot log(1+x_{ij})$\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
 
\subsection{Feature Selection}
Due to the fact that fact that the distinct
words in our dataset was very large (exceeding 60000),
it was necessary to perform dimensionality reduction 
to our data.
Besides the standard dimensionality reduction techniques
of LDA and PCA, we also applied dimensionality reduction
according to the statistical characteristics of 
our features among different classes.

In particular, we constructed a matrix $Z\in 
\mathbb{R}^{|C|\times |V|}$, where each element
$z_{ij}$ of that matrix refers to the frequency
of occurrence of term $t_j$ in class $c_i$.
%Hence $z_{ij}=\frac{\text{\# of occurrences of } t_j\text{ in }c_i}{\text{\# of terms of ci}}$
After that, for each column of matrix Z, we 
calculated the variance among the different 
classes and we selected the features with 
the highest variance value.
This way, we kept the features that best
differentiate one class from another.
It should be noted that for the best possible
results, this method was used in conjunction with
LDA or PCA.

\subsection{Classification Models}
In order to classify our articles into the different
categories, we used a wide variety of models,
such as SVM, RandomForest, GMM, NB, KNN, ANN, CNN.
Out of those, we implemented ourselves KNN, Naive
Bayes and ANN.
Apart from the above models, we also implemented
a classifier that categorizes each sample to the
class of which the mean value is closest to the
sample, which we will refer to as MEAN Classifier.

It should be noted that for the implementation of
GMM, we trained a separate Gaussian Mixture Model
for each class and we calculated the logarithmic
probability of an article belonging to a certain 
class by summing the individual log-likelihood
probabilities from every Gaussian component.

Also, for algorithms like KNN and MEAN Classifier,
we implemented several different distance metrics,
such as euclidean distance, mahalanobis distance
and cosine similarity measure.
These distance metrics are shown on the table
below.
\begin{table}[!h]
	% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
	\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2.5}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
	\hline

	\hline
	\textbf{Euclidean} & $d(x,y) = ||x-y||_2$\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Mahalanobis} & $d(x,y) = \sqrt{(x-y)^TS^{-1}(x-y)}$\\
	\hline
	\textbf{Cosine} & $d(x,y) = \frac{xy^T}{||x||_2||y||_2}$\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

our models (GMM,KNN,MEAN,RandomForest,SVM) for

\subsection{Overall Comparison}
After determining the best set of parameters
for every model, we compared the models 
with one another as shown in the figures below.
The comparisons were conducted for different reduction
methods (LDA-PCA) and different tfidf transformations
(binary, entropy and log).
Especially in the case of entropy transformation,
we conducted both LDA and PCA in order to compare
the results.

\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Individual Models}
\subsubsection{GMM}
For the GMM classifier, as seen on figure 
\ref{GMM} we can observe that the 
best accuracy  is achieved for 1 
gaussian component.
However, for a single gaussian component,
the GMM model is effectively degenerated
into a Gaussian NB classifier.
Additionaly, the second best performance
is achieved for 15 guassian components
and a full covariance matrix.
Nevertheless, in cases we have limited data, 
it is generally preferable to use a
diagonal covariance matrix because it requires 
a smaller amount of parameters
for training.

\subsubsection{KNN}
For the KNN classifier, it is evident that
the best accuracy is observed for 10 neighbors
and a cosine similarity distance metric.
